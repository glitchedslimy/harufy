## What is "Harufy"

**Harufy or Haru**, is a CLI created with one purpose: _lazyness_.</br>

> Why would I waste my time doing a whole project from 0, when I have a tool to do that for me?

You may think that, and you're correct.

So, the whole purpose of this CLI tool is to create new projects of **ANY** with all configuration with/without monorepos configured.

Yes, you have read it right _any framework_.

## What do you mean any framework?
This basically means that _haru_ will take charge of everything involved inside the framework you are using.

**Is still in development**, but you will be able to do what tools like `astro` does:

```bash
pnpm harufy add [Tool_You_Want_To_Install]
```
But translated to **every** framework, haru got it for you.

## What Harufy apports?
Well, he can:
- Configure projects
- Create projects
- Installing tools inside Windows/Linux (In progress)
- Installing tools inside the frameworks automatically for you with all the configuration needed (In progress)
- Follow the normalized convetions for packages like: eslint and prettier.
- Create monorepo projects

and many more.
