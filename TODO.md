```
- Start to make the index.ts inside the harufy CLI.
- See what type of system I follow:
    - Templates
    - Repos
    - Generative Coding
- Copy and customize what `@clack/prompts` does, and create a custom CLI kit.
- Make integration command in another package to include inside each template/repo/generative coding

# DONE
- ~~Finish up the say action to make the character appear on the console, which is a hamster called Haru~~
- ~~Need to fix the Dev command as its not bundeling the whole thing~~.
- ~~I want to bundle in different files not in one file, so I need to change that as well in the build process~~.
- ~~Fix Haru, because it doesn't have the right dimensions~~.
- ~~Make Script for building and developing the CLI~~
- ~~Finished up the actions on the prompt~~
